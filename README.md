# DataReCompression-
Here, you can get information about Data Recompression.

Data compression is a fundamental need in computer science, and I hope you have surely encountered it. Many theories and algorithms have been developed for it, which provide good performance. However, these are not enough; we need a much more powerful "Theory/Algorithm".

A Powerful Idea: "Data Re-compression".

Data recompression is an incredibly complex task. To date, no method exists that can continually compress data on demand without loss of information. However, I propose a theoretical model for data recompression that allows for a final compressed file size that can potentially approach zero.
